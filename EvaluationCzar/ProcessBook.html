			<h2>Basic Info</h2>
			<p>
				Team Name: The Industry Standards <br />
				Group members: Brian Hall, Logan Press, Matt
				Halom<br />
				Student IDs: 455024, 457670, 457234

			<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
			<p>
				Our primary motivation for this project is
				to gain an understanding of the livability
				and workability of St. Louis, MO. We are
				hoping to gain a more comprehensive
				understanding of the city to complement our
				topical impressions. We can accomplish this
				by analyzing concrete metrics related to
				several aspects of the city
				<a href="#data">(see data)</a>
				to create an interactive tool to explore St.
				Louis. This tool also serves to compare our
				subjective understandings of the city with
				objective measures. We are interested in the
				current state of St. Louis, especially in
				the areas of environment, economy, and
				mobility. As of Milestone I, our fundamental
				visualization segments the distinct
				neighborhoods of St. Louis using a
				topographical map view. The metrics
				described above will be formatted within a
				tooltip selector that contains subsequent
				data visualizations regarding a single
				neighborhood. This secondary view seeks to
				allow users to further explore the data and
				compare the information with other
				neighborhoods in St. Louis.
			</p>
			<h2>Related Work:</h2>
			<p>
				Our desire to allow users to interactively explore a city was heavily inspired
				by the New York City project shown in lecture (which we can't find now). Studio 9 inspired us to use Leaflet, because we were really 
				interested in using its ability to overlay geoJSON data. We were
				also inspired to convery our data (at least partially) as a choropleth
				map by the tile map from assigment 2.
			</p>

			<h2>Questions</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				Our objective is to create a highly
				interactive and engaging
				<i>exploratory</i> visualization for St.
				Louis which answers these questions for the
				user:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					How easy is it get around the area? Is
					there accessible public transit? How
					walkable is each area? Is biking safe
					and easy?
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the current status of the city's
					economy? How affordable is it? What is
					the local business scene like?
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
			<p>
				Our dataset consists of two data structures:
				a
				<a
					href="https://washuvis.github.io/cityliving/data/Neighborhood_Boundaries.json"
					>file </a
				>with geoJSON data that allows us to overlay
				neighborhood boundaries, and another JSON
				<a
					href="https://washuvis.github.io/cityliving/data/Neighborhood_Stats.json"
					>file
				</a>
				data that contains population, walk score,
				bike score, transit score, and ZHVI (<a
					href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-2019-highlights-26221/"
				>
					Zillow Home Value Index</a
				>) for each neighborhood.

			<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				Our dataset consists of information from
				many different sources that we pieced
				together ourselves. Rather than finding a
				dataset and exploring it to see how it could
				be represented, we had design ideas in mind
				and created our dataset so that we could
				execute those ideas. As a result, we didn't
				find it necessary to explore our data
				visually. We became familiar with it just by
				the nature of how we collected and
				synthesized it.<br /><br />
				That said, we did gain some insights while
				brainstorming how we would represent the
				data on the website for users to see. We
				initially discussed some designs to view the
				data for a single neighborhood (which can be
				seen in Iteration III of Design Evolution),
				and we quickly discovered that our data
				wasn't particularly well-suited for this.
				Instead we settled on displaying a single
				metric at a time for each neighborhood (at
				least for Milestone 1).
			</p>

			<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
			<div>
				<h4>Iteration I -</h4>
				<div id="iteration1-text">
					<p>
						Our initial visualization ideas
						centered around mapping the metro
						lines, as seen in the top two
						sketches below. The idea was that we
						could display a granular view of St.
						Louis's population distribution to
						visualize mobility with respect to
						how certain areas are
						disproprtionately served by the
						metro system. The first idea was to
						use markers with tool-tips to
						display population along with other
						data for each neighborhood. We then
						decided on visually encoding
						population like in a choropleth map
						as seen on the right. The main
						problem with these designs is that
						they focus too heavily on mobility
						and don't incorporate economic or
						environmental factors. To
						incorporate environmental data, we
						thought of including a bar graph
						indicating average temperature for
						each month. For economic data, we
						designed a focus view of the map
						with markers representing local
						businesses that the user can scroll
						over or click on to see more
						information. You can see how all
						these ideas were better fleshed out
						and synthesized under Iteration II.

				</div>
				<h4>Iteration II -</h4>
				<div id="iteration2-text">
					<p>
						For the project proposal, We
						incorporated the "filters" which
						adopt different lenses through which
						users may view the data. The filters
						are each of our target categories:
						Mobility, Economy, and Environment.
						These filters allow us to create
						different choropleth maps for each
						target. When a user hovers over a
						neighborhood, they see a tooltip
						with a breakdown of the
						neighborhood's information. Clicking
						on a neighborhood in one of these
						views expands the neighborhood
						visualization for the selection with
						the corresponding filter. For
						example, if the economy filter is
						selected, the neighborhood view
						shows markers for local businesses
						at their locations. Clicking on one
						of these markers opens another
						tooltip which provides information
						about the business itself.

				<div id="iteration3-text">
					<p>
						This iteration incorported the choropleth map we designed as an overlay on a Leaflet map of the city. 
						First, we obtained a zip folder from the City of St. Louis website with a shapefile and auxiliary info 
						for the St. Louis City neighborhoods. We plugged it into the ogr2ogr web client using the correct 
						target coordinate system and obtained the GeoJSON file we used for the overlay.
						For the data, we decided that instead of each overall "category," (mobility, economy, environment), 
						we would include every individual metric as an 
						option to filter, which may better answer the user's questions in case they are trying to 
						compare neighborhoods by a specific measure. We gathered St. Louis Metro data, and after a lot of 
						working with QGIS and trying to get the correct geoJSON format, we were unable to get the routes to overlay on 
						the city properly. Because environmental data is only gathered 
						by city and not by neighborhood (and most historical weather data you have to pay for), we 
						decided against including climate, air quality, and precipitation data on a per-neighborhood 
						basis. When the user hovers over a neighborhood in the choropleth map, a tooltip appears displaying the 
						name of the neighborhood and the value of whichever metric is currently selected by the user. 
						For the single-neighborhood visualization, we attempted redrawing the geoJSON feature for 
						the selected neighborhood, but after many attempts we didn't get it working for this iteration. We 
						began a class for this visualization with the defined methods, and currently, whenever a neighborhood 
						is clicked, the text of its name is displayed below the city visualization. We attempted to use a radar 
						graph for comparing the neighborhood's attributes, but the library we were using was deprecated, and after 
						doing some of our own research we realized that the radar graph is criticized by visualization 
						experts. Instead, we looked at other types of plots such as parallel plots or normalized bar 
						charts. All in all, we gathered nearly all the data we need; we are just missing some local businesses 
						(Matt's domain) and zillow data for a few neighborhoods (Brian was able to get data for most of the 
						neighborhoods).

			<h2>Evaluation:</h2>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> What did you learn about the data by
			using your visualizations? How did you
			answer your questions?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> We learned that the data isn't consistent; we found several neighborhoods that did not 
				have the Zillow Home Value Index. These were usually neighborhoods with very small populations. We also 
				learned that two neighborhoods were not recognized by Walk Score, the site we got our mobility data from. So, 
				the best data we got for those two neighborhoods was an estimate of the site's walkscore and bikescore, but 
				no transit score. <br>
				We also learned that the higher scores tend to be around the more populated areas. It implies an interesting 
				story about economy and infrastructure based on where people congregate; or maybe vice-versa.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> How well does your visualization work,
			and how could you further improve it?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A:</strong> The city-level visualization works pretty well, and the design doesn't hurt the eyes. There is not yet much for 
				the neighborhood visualization, but we have created a framework to begin work there.
			</p>

			<h2>Implementation:</h2>
			
				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Describe the intent and functionality of
					the interactive visualizations you
					implemented.
				</p>

				<p><strong>A:</strong> The intent is to provide a space for the user to explore different
					metrics related to the city on a neighborhood-level granularity, which can answer 
					questions about the city's livability and workability with regards to these metrics.
				</p>

					
				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Provide clear and well-referenced images
					showing the critical design and
					interaction elements.
				</p>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> These are provided in the <a href="#iteration3-header">Iteration III</a> section.
