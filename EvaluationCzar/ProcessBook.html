			<h2>Overview and Motivation</h2>
			<p>
				Our primary motivation for this project is
				to gain an understanding of the livability
				and workability of St. Louis, MO. We are
				hoping to gain a more comprehensive
				understanding of the city to complement our
				topical impressions. We can accomplish this
				by analyzing concrete metrics related to
				several aspects of the city
				<a href="#data">(see data)</a>
				to create an interactive tool to explore St.
				Louis. This tool also serves to compare our
				subjective understandings of the city with
				objective measures. We are interested in the
				current state of St. Louis, especially in
				the areas of environment, economy, and
				mobility. As of Milestone I, our fundamental
				visualization segments the distinct
				neighborhoods of St. Louis using a
				topographical map view. The metrics
				described above will be formatted within a
				tooltip selector that contains subsequent
				data visualizations regarding a single
				neighborhood. This secondary view seeks to
				allow users to further explore the data and
				compare the information with other
				neighborhoods in St. Louis.

			<h2>Questions</h2>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				Our objective is to create a highly
				interactive and engaging
				<i>exploratory</i> visualization for St.
				Louis which answers these questions for the
				user:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					How easy is it get around the area? Is
					there accessible public transit? How
					walkable is each area? Is biking safe
					and easy?
				</li>
				<li>
					What is the current status of the city's
					economy? How affordable is it? What is
					the local business scene like?
				</li>
				<li>
					What are the environmental conditions
					(weather, air quality, precipitation) in
					different areas of the city?
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
			<p>
				Our dataset consists of two data structures:
				a
				<a
					href="https://washuvis.github.io/cityliving/data/Neighborhood_Boundaries.json"
					>file </a
				>with geoJSON data that allows us to overlay
				neighborhood boundaries, and another JSON
				<a
					href="https://washuvis.github.io/cityliving/data/Neighborhood_Stats.json"
					>file
				</a>
				data that contains population, walk score,
				bike score, transit score, and ZHVI (<a
					href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zhvi-methodology-2019-highlights-26221/"
				>
					Zillow Home Value Index</a
				>) for each neighborhood.

			<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				Our dataset consists of information from
				many different sources that we pieced
				together ourselves. Rather than finding a
				dataset and exploring it to see how it could
				be represented, we had design ideas in mind
				and created our dataset so that we could
				execute those ideas. As a result, we didn't
				find it necessary to explore our data
				visually. We became familiar with it just by
				the nature of how we collected and
				synthesized it.<br /><br />
				That said, we did gain some insights while
				brainstorming how we would represent the
				data on the website for users to see. We
				initially discussed some designs to view the
				data for a single neighborhood (which can be
				seen in Iteration III of Design Evolution),
				and we quickly discovered that our data
				wasn't particularly well-suited for this.
				Instead we settled on displaying a single
				metric at a time for each neighborhood (at
				least for Milestone 1).
			</p>

			<h2>Design Evolution</h2>
			<div>
				<h4>Iteration I -</h4>
				<div id="iteration1-text">
					<p>
						Our initial visualization ideas
						centered around mapping the metro
						lines, as seen in the top two
						sketches below. The idea was that we
						could display a granular view of St.
						Louis's population distribution to
						visualize mobility with respect to
						how certain areas are
						disproprtionately served by the
						metro system. The first idea was to
						use markers with tool-tips to
						display population along with other
						data for each neighborhood. We then
						decided on visually encoding
						population like in a choropleth map
						as seen on the right. The main
						problem with these designs is that
						they focus too heavily on mobility
						and don't incorporate economic or
						environmental factors. To
						incorporate environmental data, we
						thought of including a bar graph
						indicating average temperature for
						each month. For economic data, we
						designed a focus view of the map
						with markers representing local
						businesses that the user can scroll
						over or click on to see more
						information. You can see how all
						these ideas were better fleshed out
						and synthesized under Iteration II.

					<br />
				</div>
				<h4>Iteration II -</h4>
				<div id="iteration2-text">
					<p>
						For the project proposal, We
						incorporated the "filters" which
						adopt different lenses through which
						users may view the data. The filters
						are each of our target categories:
						Mobility, Economy, and Environment.
						These filters allow us to create
						different choropleth maps for each
						target. When a user hovers over a
						neighborhood, they see a tooltip
						with a breakdown of the
						neighborhood's information. Clicking
						on a neighborhood in one of these
						views expands the neighborhood
						visualization for the selection with
						the corresponding filter. For
						example, if the economy filter is
						selected, the neighborhood view
						shows markers for local businesses
						at their locations. Clicking on one
						of these markers opens another
						tooltip which provides information
						about the business itself.

			<h2>Evaluation:</h2>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> What did you learn about the data by
			using your visualizations? How did you
			answer your questions?</p>
			<p><strong>A:</strong> So far, we have been able to learn about the fundamental metrics for each neighborhood.
				This is easy to do with the opacity function attached to each score.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Q:</strong> How well does your visualization work,
			and how could you further improve it?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>A:</strong> The visuazliation works decently well at this moment. The imporvemtns to be made will come from drawing order, and potentially refactoring the code to load in the JSON faster
			</p>

			<h2>Implementation:</h2>
			
				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Describe the intent and functionality of
					the interactive visualizations you
					implemented.
				</p>

				<p><strong>A:</strong> Its Logan's Ass
				
				</p>

					
				<p><strong>Q:</strong> Provide clear and well-referenced images
					showing the critical design and
					interaction elements.
