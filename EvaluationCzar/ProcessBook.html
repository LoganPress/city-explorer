        <h1>THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS</h1>
        <h2>Basic Info</h2>
        <p>
            Team Name:  The Industry Standards <br>
            Group members:  Brian Hall,  Logan Press,  Matt Halom</br>
            Student IDs: 455024,  457670,  457234
        </p>

        <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Our primary motivation for this project is to gain an understanding of livability and workability in various
            cities throughout the United States. We are hoping to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these
            cities to complement our topical impressions of them. We can accomplish this by analyzing concrete metrics 
            related to several aspects of the city, visualizing these metrics, and using interactability to compare our 
            subjective understandings to these objective measures. We are interested in the current state of 
            cities such as St. Louis, especially in the areas of environment, economy, and mobility.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>Our objective is to create a highly interactive and engaging <i>exploratory</i> visualization for each city of interest which answers these
            questions for the user:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How easy is it get around with a car? What about without a car? Is there accessible public transit? How walkable is each area? Is biking safe and easy?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the current status of the city's economy? How affordable is it? What is the local business scene like?
            </li>
            <li>
                What are the environmental conditions (weather, air quality, precipitation) in different areas of the city?
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to grab information using our APIs and found datasets, and store them on the server to make them
            accessible to our visualization scripts.

        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            We are not anticipating a substrantial amount of data cleanup,
            but if we find a useful source of data that needs significant wrangling.
            We are confident we have enough experience and references to handle it.
            <br><br>
            The plan is to create our own
            "custom" dataset by using several different APIs, so most of the work will be formatting
            the data from all these sources into a useful format/schema rather than rendering the data in real time.
            <br><br>
            After we've collected sufficient data for each topic of interest (mobility, environment, economy),
            we'll derive an overall score for each neighborhood in each topic. The methodology for the scores is TBD but will inlude data from the APIs listed above.  
            <br><br>
            Our data processing will be done mostly separately from the actual visualization
            implementation. Our dataset(s) should be small enough that we can feasibly
            work with CSV or JSON files like we've been doing in studios and previous assignments.
        </p>
        <h2>Visualization Design</h2>
        <div>
            <h4>Iteration I - </h4>
            <div id="iteration1-text">
                <p>
                    Our initial visualization ideas centered around mapping the metro lines, as seen in the top two sketches below.
                    The idea was that we could display a granular view of St. Louis's population distribution to visualize mobility
                    with respect to how certain areas are disproprtionately served by the metro system. The first idea was to use markers 
                    with tool-tips to display population along with other data for each neighborhood. We eventually decided that visually
                    encoding population like in a choropleth map as seen on the right. The main problem with these designs is that they 
                    focus too heavily on mobility and don't incorporate economic or environmental factors. To incorporate environmental data,
                    we thought of including a bar graph indicating average temperature for each month. For economic data, we designed a focus
                    view of the map with markers representing local businesses that the user can scroll over or click on to see more information.
                    You can see how all these ideas were better fleshed out and synthesized under Iteration II.

            </div>
            <h4>Iteration II - </h4>
            <div id="iteration2-text">
                <p>
                    We incorporated the other factors we are exploring for this project by creating "filters" which adopt different lenses 
                    through which to view the data. The filters are each of our target categories: Mobility, Economy, and Environment. These 
                    filters allow us to create different choropleth maps for each target. When a user hovers over a neighborhood, they 
                    see a tooltip with a breakdown of the neighborhood's information. Clicking on a neighborhood in one of these views 
                    expands the neighborhood visualization for the selection with the corresponding filter. For example, if the economy filter 
                    is selected, the neighborhood view shows markers for local businesses at their locations. Clicking on one of these markers 
                    opens another tooltip which provides information about the business itself.
