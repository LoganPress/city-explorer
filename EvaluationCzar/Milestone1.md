# Instructions 

## Expectations
For your Milestone 1, I expect you to hand in the following: 

1. Your code
2. Your process book in its current state. This should be a webpage, and it should also contain the original designs from your project proposal and updates that you have made. (See final project description for additional details.)
3. Your website template.

For your Milestone 1, you should have completed your data acquisition, or at least have a significant sample of your data. You must have your data structures in place. For example, if you plan to collect 1000 data records, but only have 200, that's fine. If you are missing one of two datasets, you will lose points since you have to have the whole structure.

You must have a working visualization prototype. It is not required to have all your views up and running, and it ok if it is not entirely interactive, but the direction and the content must be clear.

If you are uncertain about the scope, please contact me.
